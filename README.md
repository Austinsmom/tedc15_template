[The Email Design Conference 2015](http://litmus.com/conference) // #TEDC15

Developing email that’s flexible enough to adapt to the large number of clients that exist—new and old—can be a challenge. Some clients, like Microsoft Outlook, have outdated and poor-performing rendering engines. Others, like Gmail, have user bases that can’t be ignored, but render emails terribly.

This code is an illustration of the concepts of Spongy Development (a.k.a Hybrid Coding) and Pattern-based Design (a.k.a Atomic Design). It's all built in modular fashion, with the aim of providing baseline code for robust, flexibly-built emails that perform well and are “responsive” across a variety of clients without relying on media queries or other modern development techniques.

This is all of the code I covered in my talk, Resposive Email Without Media Queries, and it was put together pretty quickly, which means there may be some rough edges here and there; I'll fix issues as I find them, and will push the optimized to this repository for a few more days.

Hope you find it helpful in your own work!

Cheers,
